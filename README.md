## Motivation
Currently, there are no NUS-based or even Singapore-based crowdfunding platforms. We aim to address the need for a localized fundraising platform within the NUS/Singapore community. Many projects are scattered across multiple Telegram channels, physical posters in school, and emails that are difficult to track. We want to create a simple and accessible app that allows NUS students and Singaporeans to raise funds for shirts, keychains, and other merchandise to support local causes and events. This app will also enable users to track the progress of fundraising events and receive updates on their projects. Additionally, the app can extend to event registration and management, allowing event organizers to gauge interest and create polls to better plan and organize their events based on expected turnout.

While international platforms like Kickstarter exist, they may not cater specifically to local causes or events. It can be difficult to crowdfund or pool money together to ‘group buy’ items just for hall/hostel students. Additionally, Kickstarter charges a high fee (5%), and when coupled with international taxes and other fees, it becomes impractical to host local projects.

giving.sg is a platform dedicated to local causes and projects. However, it is limited to monetary donations and fundraising projects. We believe that offering purchasable products as an option to raise funds is a more effective way to attract participation.

## Aim
Our aim is to create an all-encompassing centralised platform for users (primarily targeted towards NUS students) which help them to raise funds for their events, as well as assisting individuals in kick-starting their own self-initiated projects. Projects will be listed with important and relevant details and a brief summarised description, including the objectives of the initiative. The platform will be catered specifically towards local projects and initiatives, and will be non-profit-motivated so as to keep costs and barriers-to-entry low for individuals to lift their projects off the ground. 

The project aims to cater more specifically to the interests and needs of NUS students by having a more localised focus area. The platform will have diversified features to assist with fundraising and publicity, such as event categorisation and event management. Project creators will have the option when creating their project to include an online shop to display their merchandise.

The platform will also have features that are targeted towards enhancing user experience, and these include project recommendations based on user search history and preferences, as well as the ability to bookmark or favourite certain projects.
